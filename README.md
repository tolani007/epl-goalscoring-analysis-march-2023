Main takeaways: 
Firmino is still a reliable goalscorer when fit.
Halaand is an elite goalscorer but you probably already knew that.
Crysencio Summerville (21), Brennan Johnson (21), Degnand Gnoto (19) are young hidden gems to look out for and I predit they would put up better numbers in a team that creates more chances for them.
Although Gabriel Jesus is underperforming his xG his general play does seem to improve the goals and assists numbers of the attackers arround him.
